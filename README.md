## Group 1 Data Representation, Analysis and Visualisation
In times of upheaval, stories become mirrors through which we perceive the world. Once seen as outliers, have antiheroes now claimed a new place in the hearts of audiences? Using data as our guide, we trace the emotional undercurrents before and after the pandemic to uncover the evolving perception of antihero figures in collective consciousness.

We believe that data is more than just numbersâ€”it is the imprint of emotions. Through sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, topic modeling, and time-series forecasting, we seek to answer a fundamental question: Has societal change propelled antiheroes into the mainstream?

This is not just an analysis of data but an interpretation of narratives. After the pandemic, we continue searching for heroes, but perhaps our heroes are no longer perfect ideals. Instead, they may be the ones who navigate the gray areas, standing at the crossroads of light and shadow.
